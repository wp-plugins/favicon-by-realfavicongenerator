== Description ==

Favicon is not just a single `favicon.ico` file dropped in the middle of your site. Nowadays, with so many different platforms and devices, you need a bunch of pictures to get the job done.

iOS devices use a high resolution Apple touch icon to illustrate bookmarks and home screen shortcuts. A first generation iPhone needs a 57x57 picture, whereas a brand new iPad with Retina screen looks for a 152x152 picture. Android Chrome also use this pictures if it finds them. Windows 8 takes another route with a dedicated set of icons and HTML declarations.

Favicon is not only a matter of pictures with different resolutions. The various platforms coms with different UI guidelines. For example, the classic desktop favicons often use transparency. But iOS requires opaque icons. And Windows 8 has its own recommendations.
